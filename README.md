# Twitter NLP Sentiment Multi-classification Model with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (BRNN) using Keras & TensorFlow
This project details the initial creation of a multi-classification Recurent Neural Network (RNN) model using Tensorflow / Keras to predict Tweet emotions. More specifically, this notebook uses a bidirectional LSTM as a means to capture additional semantics often found in sequential (language) data. This project utilizes the Tweet Emotion Recognition with TensorFlow dataset provided by Kaggle.
